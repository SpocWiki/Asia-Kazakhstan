## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Almaty**, formerly Alma-Ata, is the largest city in Kazakhstan, 
> with a population exceeding two million residents within its metropolitan area. 
> Located in the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains in southern Kazakhstan, 
> near the border with Kyrgyzstan, 
> Almaty stands as a pivotal center of culture, commerce, finance and innovation. 
> 
> The city is nestled at an elevation of 700–900 metres (2,300–3,000 feet), 
> with the Big Almaty and Small Almaty rivers running through it, 
> originating from the surrounding mountains and flowing into the plains. 
> 
> Almaty is the second-largest city in Central Asia 
> and the fourth-largest in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
>
> Almaty served as the capital of Kazakhstan from 1929 to 1997 during the Soviet era and after independence from 1991 until the capital was relocated to Akmola (now Astana) in 1997. Despite no longer being the capital, Almaty remains the most cosmopolitan and influential city in Kazakhstan, often regarded as the nation's cultural and financial heart, and is colloquially referred to as the "Southern Capital". It is classified as a city of republican significance, granting it autonomy from regional governance. The city is divided into eight administrative districts within the framework of its republican significance.
>
> Almaty has hosted international events, including the Alma-Ata Primary Healthcare Conference in 1978, which shaped global public health policy, the 2011 Asian Winter Games, and the 2017 Winter Universiade. The city was also a contender to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, further solidifying its position as an international hub for winter sports, but ultimately lost the bid to Beijing.
>
> Almaty is served by an extensive transportation network, including Almaty International Airport, the busiest in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, handling over 9.5 million passengers annually. The city is also served by the Almaty Metro, opened in 2011. Additionally, buses and trolleybuses contribute to the city's comprehensive public transport system.
>
> Almaty’s proximity to natural attractions such as the Ile-Alatau National Park, with its diverse ecosystems and scenic trails, and Big Almaty Lake, makes it a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. Additionally, the city's close proximity to Medeu, the highest-altitude ice rink in the world, and Shymbulak ski resort, contributes to Almaty’s reputation as a major tourism hub for adventure and outdoor activities.
>
> A member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network since 2017 in the field of music, Almaty is renowned for its cultural contributions. It is also classified as a Gamma + level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, underscoring its economic and regional significance. Almaty is celebrated for its green spaces, with numerous urban parks, tree-lined streets, and fountains, contributing to its reputation as one of the greenest cities in the region. The city’s skyline blends historical Soviet-era buildings with modern skyscrapers, symbolizing its ongoing economic development and evolving identity.
>
> Key landmarks and attractions in Almaty include the Central State Museum of Kazakhstan, Ascension Cathedral, Green Bazaar, Arbat, and Kök Töbe, a hilltop destination offering panoramic views of the city and the surrounding mountains. The city is also home to prestigious educational institutions such as Al-Farabi Kazakh National University, the Kazakh-British Technical University, the International Information Technology University, and Narxoz University.
