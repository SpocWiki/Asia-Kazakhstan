## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The **Aral Sea** was an endorheic salt lake lying 
> between Kazakhstan to its north and Uzbekistan to its south, 
> which began shrinking in the 1960s 
> and had largely dried up into desert by the 2010s. 
> 
> It was in the Aktobe and Kyzylorda regions of Kazakhstan 
> and the Karakalpakstan autonomous region of Uzbekistan. 
> The name roughly translates from Mongolic and Turkic languages to 
> "Sea of Islands", a reference to the large number of islands (over 1,100) 
> that once dotted its waters. 
> The Aral Sea drainage basin encompasses Uzbekistan and parts of Afghanistan, 
> Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
>
> Formerly the third-largest lake in the world with an area of 68,000 km2 (26,300 sq mi), 
> the Aral Sea began shrinking in the 1960s 
> after the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects. 
> By 2007, it had declined to 10% of its original size, splitting into four lakes: 
> the North Aral Sea, the eastern and western basins of the once far larger South Aral Sea, 
> and the smaller intermediate Barsakelmes Lake. 
> 
> By 2009, the southeastern lake had disappeared 
> and the southwestern lake had retreated to a thin strip 
> at the western edge of the former southern sea. 
> 
> In subsequent years occasional water flows have led to 
> the southeastern lake sometimes being replenished to a small degree. 
> Satellite images by NASA in August 2014 revealed that for the first time in modern history 
> the eastern basin of the Aral Sea had completely dried up. 
> The eastern basin is now called the Aralkum Desert.
>
> In a Kazakhstani effort to save and replenish the North Aral Sea, 
> the Dike Kokaral dam was completed in 2005. 
> By 2008, the water level had risen 12 m (39 ft) above that of 2003, to 42 m (138 ft). 
> As of 2013, salinity dropped, and fish were again present in sufficient numbers 
> for some fishing to be viable.
>
> After the visit to Muynak in 2011, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon 
> called the shrinking of the Aral Sea "one of the planet's worst environmental disasters". 
> The region's once-prosperous fishing industry has been devastated, 
> bringing unemployment and economic hardship. 
> 
> The water from the diverted Syr Darya river is used to 
> irrigate about two million hectares (5,000,000 acres) of farmland in the Ferghana Valley.  
> 
> The Aral Sea region is heavily polluted, with consequent serious public health problems. 
> 
> UNESCO has added historical documents concerning the Aral Sea 
> to its Memory of the World Register as a resource to study the environmental tragedy.
