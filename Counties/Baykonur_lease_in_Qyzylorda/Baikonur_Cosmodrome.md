> The Baikonur Cosmodrome is a spaceport operated by Russia within Kazakhstan. 
> Located in the Kazakh city of Baikonur, 
> it is the largest operational space launch facility in terms of area. 
> All Russian crewed spaceflights are launched from Baikonur.
>
> Situated in the Kazakh Steppe, some 90 metres (300 ft) above sea level, 
> it is 200 kilometres (120 mi) to the east of the Aral Sea and north of the Syr Darya. 
> 
> It is close to TÃ¶retam, a station on the Trans-Aral Railway. 
> Russia, as the official successor state to the Soviet Union, 
> has retained control over the facility since 1991; 
> it originally assumed this role through the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), 
> but ratified an agreement with Kazakhstan in 2005 that allowed it to lease the spaceport until 2050. 
> It is jointly managed by Roscosmos and the Russian Aerospace Forces.
>
> In 1955, the Soviet Ministry of Defense issued a decree and founded the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was originally built as the chief base of operations for the Soviet space program. The Cosmodrome served as the launching point for Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1. The launchpad used for both missions was renamed "Gagarin's Start" in honour of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who piloted Vostok 1 and became the first human in outer space. Under the current Russian management, Baikonur remains a busy spaceport, with numerous commercial, military, and scientific missions being launched annually.
