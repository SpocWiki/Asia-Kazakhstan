> Nursultan Abishuly Nazarbayev (born 6 July 1940) is a Kazakh politician 
> who served as the first president of Kazakhstan from 1991 to 2019. 
> He also held the special title of Elbasy from 2010 to 2022 
> and chairman of the Security Council from 1991 to 2022.
>
> Nazarbayev’s political career began in the Soviet era, 
> where he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1962 
> while working as a steel factory worker. 
> 
> Rising through the party ranks, he became Prime Minister of the Kazakh SSR in 1984 
> and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in 1989. 
> 
> In 1990, the Supreme Soviet elected him as the president of Kazakhstan. 
> Nazarbayev played a key role in navigating Kazakhstan through the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 
> leading to the country's independence in 1991. 
> 
> In the country’s first direct 1991 presidential election, 
> Nazarbayev appeared on the ballot without opposition and secured an overwhelming victory. 
> 
> In 1995, ruling by decree, Nazarbayev extended his presidency through a referendum 
> and adopted a new constitution that expanded his powers. 
> He was re-elected in 1999, deemed eligible to run again in 2005 by a Supreme Court ruling, 
> and benefited from a 2007 constitutional amendment solely exempting term limits for him, 
> allowing re-elections in 2011 and 2015.
>
> Under Nazarbayev's rule, Kazakhstan experienced substantial economic growth, 
> driven by high oil prices and market-oriented reforms. 
> 
> His policies focused on modernizing infrastructure, attracting foreign investment, 
> and positioning Kazakhstan as an economic hub in Central Asia. 
> 
> On the international stage, he prioritized strong ties with global powers 
> and Kazakhstan's integration into regional and global organizations, 
> including the Eurasian Economic Union and the World Trade Organization. 
> Nazarbayev also gained recognition for his efforts in nuclear disarmament, 
> renouncing Kazakhstan’s inherited nuclear arsenal, and closing the Semipalatinsk Test Site. 
> 
> However, his presidency was also marked by widespread corruption, nepotism, kleptocracy, 
> and economic challenges, such as the Great Recession, the 2010s oil glut, 
> and economic repercussions from the Russo-Ukrainian War. 
> 
> These issues contributed to inflation and the devaluation of the national currency, 
> the tenge, while undermining transparency and governance.
>
> In March 2019, following a wave of protests and increasing discontent, 
> Nazarbayev announced his resignation, handing over power to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. 
> Tokayev was elected president in a snap election in June 2019. 
> 
> While Nazarbayev stepped down from the presidency, 
> he remained a powerful figure in Kazakh politics, 
> retaining influence through his leadership of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan 
> and the Nur Otan party. 
> 
> He also chaired the Security Council until his dismissal in 2022. 
> Nazarbayev’s power was diminished following the 2022 unrest, 
> which led to a constitutional referendum that stripped him of many privileges and titles, 
> including his membership in the Senate and the Constitutional Council. 
> By 2023, he had lost most of his official titles, signaling the end of his political dominance.
>
> Nazarbayev was one of the longest-ruling non-royal leaders in the world, 
> having led Kazakhstan for nearly three decades, 
> excluding chairmanship in the Security Council after the end of his presidency. 
> 
> He has often been referred to as a dictator due to his consolidation of power and autocratic rule. 
> While he is credited with fostering economic growth and political stability in Kazakhstan, 
> his tenure was marred by widespread authoritarianism, significant human rights abuses, 
> and systemic corruption. 
> 
> His leadership was further characterized by a pervasive cult of personality, 
> with his image and influence deeply entrenched in the nation’s political and social landscape.
